Box-Jenkins Sales Analysis: Time Series Insights &amp; Predictability

DESCRIPTION:
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the Box-Jenkins (BJ) Sales dataset, originally collected in 1970. 
The dataset consists of 150 months of sales data alongside a leading indicator, providing a valuable foundation for exploring 
whether sales growth follows a predictable trend over time.

FEATURES:
*Data Preparation - Converting time series data into a structured format for statistical analysis.
*Descriptive Statistics - Evaluating key metrics such as mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis.
*Trend Visualization - Scatter plots and regression models illustrating long-term sales behavior.
*Leading Indicator Analysis - Assessing external influences on sales fluctuations.
*Time Series Forecasting - Investigating predictability using ARIMA modeling techniques.

RESEARCH QUESTION: Does sales growth follow a predictable trend over time?

ANALYSIS: Sales growth does appear to follow a predictable trend over time, but with some variability in several aspects of the data set, such as fluctuations around the trend line, standard deviation in sales, and leading indicator effects. The linear regression trend line shows that sales increase gradually over time, suggesting a positive trend. Upon research and analysis, the mean (229.98) and standard deviation (21.48) of sales of the dataset suggest a level of sales stability.  For Distribution Analysis, the negative skewness (-1.54) suggests that higher sales months are more common than the lower ones. The leading indicator fluctuates (9.75 to 13.87), which might impact future sales trends.
